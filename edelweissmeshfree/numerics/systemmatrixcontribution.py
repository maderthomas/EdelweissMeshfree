"""Where entities write their stiffness contribution, and how it becomes a CSR matrix.

Two implementations of one interface, so the solvers do not have to know which is in use:

:class:`VIJContribution`
    Stage into a ``sizeVIJ``-long value array, then gather duplicates into CSR. The long-standing
    behaviour.
:class:`DirectCSRContribution`
    Scatter each entity's block straight into CSR, with no value array at all. That array and its
    gather map are the dominant memory cost of a meshfree assembly -- 19.53 GiB of the 20.33 GiB the
    VIJ path spends at 43,350 DOF -- and the DOF ceiling is set by memory, not by assembly time.

The interface is deliberately the one the contributors already used: ``K[entity]`` hands back the
array an entity writes its block into. What differs is what happens afterwards. The VIJ array *is*
the accumulator, so nothing has to happen; the direct path has to push the block through the offset
map, which :meth:`DirectCSRContribution.flush` does.

class DirectCSRContribution(SystemMatrixContributionBase):
    """Scatter each entity's block straight into CSR, with no staging array.

    One scratch block is reused for every entity, so this holds kilobytes where the VIJ path holds
    gigabytes. It is handed out by :meth:`__getitem__` and committed by :meth:`flush`, and because
    handing out a *new* block flushes the previous one, a caller cannot forget to commit -- only the
    last block of an assembly needs :meth:`flush`, and :meth:`toCSR` does that itself.

    **Zeroed, not accumulated.** Where the VIJ array let two contributors for the same entity
    accumulate in the same slab, each gets a freshly zeroed block here and each block is scattered
    separately. The sum in CSR is the same, because no contributor reads what another wrote -- every
    one of them either adds to or overwrites a block it was given. Anything that starts *reading* its
    block would need this revisited.

    **Single-threaded.** Everything routed through here (cells, elements, constraints, loads) is
    evaluated sequentially and is under 2% of the runtime. The threaded particle kernels do not come
    through here at all: they call ``scatterBlock`` from inside their own ``prange``, with a real
    thread id and a per-thread scratch block. A threaded caller reaching this class would need a
    thread-to-buffer mapping to stay race-free, so :meth:`__getitem__` refuses rather than guessing.
