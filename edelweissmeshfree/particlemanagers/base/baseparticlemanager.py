Particle managers are responsible for the connectivity between particles and shape functions.
They track the particles and shape functions and update the connectivity between them.

Compared to the MPM, several subtle differences exist between the particle managers:
- Each particle vertice may be reside in multiple shape functions, whereas a material point vertex can be in only one cell.
- For nodally integrated ((semi-)Lagrangian) shape functions, no inactive cells exist, whereas for the material point method, inactive cells exist.

        A particle contributes to the global equation system through the nodes of its kernel
        functions, so its mapping into the degree-of-freedom vector only has to be rebuilt when that
        set changes. Reporting *which* particles changed, rather than only *whether* any did, is what
        lets a solver rebuild a handful of mappings instead of all of them.

        Empty whenever :meth:`updateConnectivity` returned ``False``. A manager that cannot track
        which individual particles changed may fall back to reporting all of them even when
        ``True`` was returned -- conservative, since a caller that rebuilds more mappings than
        necessary is merely slower, never wrong.
