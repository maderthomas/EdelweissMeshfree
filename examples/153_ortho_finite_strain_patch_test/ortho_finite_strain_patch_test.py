Patch test of the orthotropic finite-strain RKPM discretisation, over the bedding orientation.

WHAT A PATCH TEST IS HERE.  A homogeneous linear displacement field u_i = A_ij X_j is imposed
on the boundary of a square patch of randomly perturbed particles, and the interior is required
to reproduce that field.  Nothing about it is a fit: the exact solution is a member of the
approximation space (a linear basis reproduces a linear field), and a homogeneous deformation
gradient produces a homogeneous Kirchhoff stress, so div tau = 0 is satisfied exactly and the
exact solution is also the exact solution of the discrete problem.  Any departure is therefore
a defect of the discretisation -- of the reproducing conditions, of the domain integration, or
of the way the essential conditions are imposed -- and not a discretisation error in the usual
sense.  That is what makes the test binary rather than a convergence statement.

WHY OVER THE BEDDING ORIENTATION.  The material is orthotropic at finite strain, and off the
material axes the Biot stress and the elastic stretch stop being coaxial (main.tex Sec. 3.1,
Fig. 4): the constitutive routine then exercises the full non-symmetric Mandel stress, the
spectral evaluation of d ln U / dU with distinct eigenvalues, and the Walpole mapping tensor in
a frame that is not the coordinate frame.  A patch test run only at beta = 0 misses all of it.
The sweep below therefore runs every load case at seven bedding orientations from 0 to 90 deg.

WHY THREE LOAD CASES.  A single one can pass by accident.  Uniaxial stretch keeps the stretch
coaxial with the coordinate axes; simple shear makes the deformation gradient non-symmetric;
the mixed case is coaxial with neither the coordinate axes nor the material axes at any
orientation in the sweep.  All three are homogeneous, so all three have the same exact-solution
property.

A FOURTH CASE, AND WHY.  The three above are pure gradients, u = A X, which leave the origin
fixed and test only the first-order part of the reproducing conditions.  `affine` carries a
translation as well, u = c + A X with c = (0.10, 0.05) mm and A = [[0.10, 0.20], [0.15, 0.10]],
so it tests the zeroth-order part too -- that a rigid translation is reproduced exactly -- and
it is the largest deformation in this file, det F = 1.18.  It is not in the Fig. 14 sweep; it
has its own study and its own figure, `--affine`, which adds the ENERGY error to the two below
and shows both as contours over the patch.

WHAT IS MEASURED
    err(u)  max over interior particles of |u_num - u_ex| / max|u_ex|
    err(F)  max over interior particles of |F_num - (I + A)| / |A|
    err(E)  max over interior particles of |Psi(F_num) - Psi(F_ex)| / Psi(F_ex), with Psi the
            STORED energy density Psi^e(U) - Psi^e(I).  Marmot does not export it, so it is
            evaluated here with the paper's own reference implementation of the potential.
    alphaP  the hardening variable, which must be identically zero -- the check that the run
            really was elastic, and hence that the exact-solution argument applies at all.
The strengths are scaled by 1e3 so that no orientation can yield at the amplitudes used; the
elastic card is the one of examples/152 with its AXES RELABELLED so that the soft modulus is
the one across the bedding, e^(1) -- see the note above E1 -- and the Walpole weights are made
transversely isotropic about the same axis, so that the elastic anisotropy and the plastic one
are the same anisotropy.  Everything else is the card of examples/152.  NOTE that 152 itself
has not been changed; whether to propagate this is open.

THE THREE THINGS THE TEST SETTLED, each a switch of its own
    --bc {face,center,cwf}   where the essential condition acts.  `face` is the one that
        works; `center` is the instructive failure (2 % error, insensitive to everything);
        `cwf` adds the consistent-weak-form correction, which does not converge on a fully
        constrained boundary -- see sweepBoundary().
    --perturb X              how random the distribution is, in units of h_p.  Limited by the
        VALIDITY of the quad cells, not by the approximation: see sweepPerturbation() and
        cellQuality(), which counts concave cells.
    --particle {sqcni,sqcni_r,sqcni_ru,snni,...}   how the smoothing domain is carried into
        the deformed configuration.  Only the full deformation gradient passes for every load
        case; see sweepUpdateType().
