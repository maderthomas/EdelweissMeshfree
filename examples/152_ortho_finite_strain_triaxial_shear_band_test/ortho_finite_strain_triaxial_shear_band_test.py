Plane-strain COMPRESSION of a bedded specimen, RKPM meshfree, with the
gradient-enhanced orthotropic finite-strain damage-plasticity model
``GRADIENTENHANCEDORTHOCDPFINITESTRAIN`` -- run to a localised inclined SHEAR BAND, and
used to show what the PLASTIC CONVECTION OF THE MATERIAL FRAME does inside that band.

WHAT THIS TEST IS FOR
---------------------
The material carries its orthotropy axes on the intermediate stress-free configuration.
Until recently they were frozen at the card orientation at every state; they are now a
closed-form function of the stored plastic deformation gradient (eq. framestate of the
paper),

    e1(Fp) = Fp^-T n0 / ||.||,   e2(Fp) = (I - e1 x e1) Fp e2_0 / ||.||,   e3 = e1 x e2

i.e. the bedding normal is transported as the normal of a material SURFACE and an in-plane
material LINE by Fp.  A shear band that cuts ACROSS the bedding is exactly where the two
choices part company: the frozen frame drifts 14.3 / 28.1 / 53.1 deg from the convected
bedding normal at an accumulated band shear of 0.25 / 0.5 / 1.0.  This test puts a real
band on the screen and measures that drift in it.

The optional 33rd material property selects the frame:  1 = convected (default, the paper),
0 = frozen (legacy).  ``--frozen`` runs the legacy variant, and ``--compare`` runs both and
overlays them.

MODEL
-----
* RKPM, completeness order 1, implicit-gradient approximation, box B-spline kernels;
  one nodally integrated POINT particle per cell (``GradientEnhancedFiniteStrain/PlaneStrain/Point``).
* Two nodal fields: ``displacement`` and ``nonlocal damage`` (the implicit-gradient
  Helmholtz field that regularises the softening).
* Material card: the calibrated Sect.-4 set of T. Mader et al., Acta Mechanica (2023),
  https://doi.org/10.1007/s00707-023-03706-z, with the paper's own 'bedded' Walpole weight
  set relabelled into the code's axis order (the code puts the bedding NORMAL first, main.tex
  puts it second).

SPECIMEN, SUPPORTS AND WHY THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE
-------------------------------------------------
Rectangle W x H = 10 x 20 mm, load axis y.  The nonlocal length l = 1.25 mm is FIXED by the
material, so the SPECIMEN is sized against it (H/l = 16) rather than the other way round --
the first cylinder study never localised because l equalled the specimen radius and the
Helmholtz averaging spanned the whole body.

    bottom face (y = 0) : u_y = 0                 frictionless platen
    top face (y = H)    : u_y = -uMax             frictionless platen, uMax = 20 % of H
    one bottom particle : u_x = 0                 kills the x translation, nothing else

FREE LATERAL BOUNDARIES, and that is a deliberate choice with a caveat.  A triaxial cell
applies a CONSTANT CONFINING PRESSURE, and that load is not available here: a nodally
integrated point particle carries no faces, so ``ParticleDistributedLoad`` (which needs an
``EntityBasedSurface``) cannot reach it, and ``computeDistributedLoad`` is a no-op -- exactly
as in the micropolar point particle this one derives from.  The two substitutes that ARE
available were both tried and both are wrong for this purpose:

* prescribing the lateral displacement and holding it is K0 / oedometer compression, not a
  triaxial test.  Measured: it drives the mid-height axial stress to -434 MPa at 20 %
  shortening (against fcu* = 51 MPa) and leaves omega below 0.006, because a fully laterally
  restrained state is plastically COMPACTIVE and this model's damage is driven by plastic
  volumetric EXPANSION.  No band forms, by construction.
* a soft penalty as a stand-in for a pressure membrane does not work either: the penalty
  weak Dirichlet constraint acts on the INCREMENT (its force is k*(du - d*df_t)), so a small
  k gives an increment-size-dependent force rather than a constant one.

So this is a plane-strain COMPRESSION (biaxial) test with free lateral boundaries.  That is
the configuration in which this material was previously shown to localise a genuine inclined
shear band, and it is the harder case for the frame update, since nothing suppresses the
lateral expansion that the plastic flow needs.  Adding a real constant-pressure confinement
means implementing a boundary-surface-vector load for the point particle (the VCI machinery
already passes such vectors in ``vci_compute_Test_P_BoundaryIntegral``); that is a follow-up,
not a workaround.

Two ingredients are needed to get a band in the MIDDLE rather than at the platens:

* HARD CAPS -- the top and bottom two rows get all four strengths x3.  Implicit-gradient
  damage with natural (zero-flux) boundary conditions reads HIGH at a boundary, because the
  nonlocal average cannot be diluted by material outside the specimen, and with the
  over-nonlocal weight m = 1.05 that is amplified until damage nucleates at both loaded ends
  and saturates there.  A stronger seed does NOT fix it (going x0.98 -> x0.70 barely moves
  the mid/end damage contrast, which is what proves the end damage is a boundary artefact);
  hard caps do.
* A WEAK SEED -- one patch at mid-height on the left edge gets all four strengths x0.90, to
  pick out one band instead of letting damage smear over the whole core.

    # TWO LOADING MODES, and the choice matters more than any material parameter:
    #
    #  "compression" -- axial shortening of a slender specimen.  This is the configuration of
    #      the earlier sessions, and on a mesh with h <= l it does NOT work: the run terminates
    #      at the PLASTIC limit load with omega still ~2e-4, because in compression this model's
    #      damage is driven by plastic volumetric EXPANSION and grows far too slowly to take
    #      over the softening.  The tangent is singular there (dqH/dalphaP vanishes
    #      quadratically at alphaP = 1) and the implicit-gradient regularisation, which acts on
    #      the DAMAGE, is not yet doing anything.  Neither a residual hardening slope, nor
    #      moving the damage onset, nor a longer solver leash, nor dropping the confinement
    #      gets a full curve out of it -- each buys a little more strain (2.09 % -> 3.6 % at
    #      best) and then stalls.  The material README says as much: "use 3D with free lateral
    #      faces, not plane strain".
    #
    #  "shear" (the default) -- SIMPLE SHEAR of the same panel.  Two reasons it behaves:
    #      almost no axial elastic energy is stored, so there is nothing to drive a snap-back;
    #      and shearing across the bedding is dilatant from the start, so damage engages early
    #      and the regularised damage softening -- not unregularised perfect plasticity -- is
    #      what governs the localisation.  That is also the state the material-point check
    #      test/frame_update_check.cpp exercises, where the frame turns 16.9 deg at gamma = 0.6.
